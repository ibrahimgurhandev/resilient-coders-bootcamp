      <h3>Our History</h3>
      <p>The Japanese Women’s Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006
        by three visionary women in Boston, Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish,
        Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women
        leaders, referred to as the Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive
        four weeks of hands-on experience and training with successful nonprofit
        organizations in nonprofit management and leadership development. During
        their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an Action Plan, which will
        serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their dreams of social change a
        reality. After returning to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make a
        difference in their communities based on their Action Plans. The purpose
        of this program is for the fellows to share the knowledge and experience
        they acquired in Boston with other women and social sector leaders within
        Japan.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based
        nonprofit organizations, is administering JWLI in partnership with Simmons
        College School of Management’s Center for Gender in Organizations.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S. – Japan Foundation,
        JWLI expanded its vision to hold public forums within Japan. Held in 2010,
        2012 and 2013, these public forums provided information about the nonprofit
        sector and the American approach to philanthropy with hopes to inspire women
        to take leadership roles. The Forum Program reached hundreds of Japanese
        citizens, advocating for their involvement in addressing the needs of Japanese
        society.</p>

        <span>Atsuko Toko Fish - Founder</span><br>

        Atsuko Toko Fish retired as a U.S.-Japan cross-cultural consultant,
        and is currently involved with various social innovative movements
        as a philanthropist. She is also a founding trustee of the Fish
        Family Foundation. To accelerate social change by women leaders,
        Atsuko founded the Champion of Change Japan Award (CCJA) in 2017
        and is launching the JWLI Bootcamp in June, 2019. In the wake of
        3.11, Atsuko established the Japanese Disaster Relief Fund-Boston
        (JDRFB) to support immediate and mid-term recovery in Tohoku.
        Atsuko visited the effected region several times to assess and
        evaluate the fast-changing needs of the people and community.
        In the two years the fund was active for, JDRFB raised approximately
        $1 million and distributed 24 grants to 19 organizations and projects
        working directly in Tohoku. It has been reported by the grantees
        that JDRFB’s $1 million grants were leveraged for $6 million of
        economic impact.</p>
